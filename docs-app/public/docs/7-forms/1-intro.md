# Forms

Forms should be handled by and built with [this styleless Forms implementation][gh-headless-form]. The library provides provides a way to [build your fields][gh-custom-controls], which we will use with the unque, non-native fields provided by `ember-primitives` 


> [ember-headless-form] distills the common behavior and accessibility best practices of forms into reusable components, without any opinions on specific markup or styling. Use it to build your forms directly, or to build your opinionated forms component kit on top of it.
