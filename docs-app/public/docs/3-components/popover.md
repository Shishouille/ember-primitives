# Popover

Popovers are built with [ember-velcro][gh-e-velcro], which is an ergonomic wrapper around [Floating UI][docs-floating], the successor to older (and more clunky) [Popper.JS][docs-popper]. 

The goal of a popover is to provide additional behavioral functionality to make interacting with popovers easier:
- focus trapping
- focus returning
